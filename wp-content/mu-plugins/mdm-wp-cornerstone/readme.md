# MDM WP-Cornerstone

Our base plugin boilerplate for creating *site specific* functionality plugins. An **upgrader** class will **not** be included in this plugin, since it's intended to be customized for each install.

Instead, updates to the base plugin architecture will be reflected here, but not ported to past installations.

## TODO
- Add *some* of the .js modules from MPress that are good stand-alone components, to be ported to each theme
- Add *some* foundational style classes from MPress that are good stand-alone components ( content grids, for instance )

## Changelog
